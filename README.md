# Hello-World
Just another repository

Hi! As a rookie of code, I think I need to practise more.

This is the first time to use GitHub, and feel that many functions are very useful. 
In the future, I will submit some codes from time to time to record my learning process.

Such as C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS......
